# iso-island

Iso-Island is an isometric island generator using Perlin noise to generate the layers of ground for the island as well as the connection between the land and water.

The challenge with this project was getting 4 houses to spawn on opposites of a generated island to act as 4 different players. This project is an isometric version of a hex grid multiplayer corridor-like game I was working on with procedural map generation, it just looks cleaner and has no multiplayer aspects at the current stage.
